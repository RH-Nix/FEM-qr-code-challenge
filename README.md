## My process
The HTML portion was easy. When it came to CSS specifically flexbox and media queries is where I spent alot of my time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I had the basics down but when it came to positioning items I got really stuck. I knew I wanted to use flexbox but I couldn't figure out the layout. Haven't finished my CSS study so I didn't know about media queries until starting this project. Really helped alot.

### Continued development

Satisfied for now

### Useful resources
